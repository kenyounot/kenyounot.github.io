An area I have had problem with for the past couple of years is writers block. That doesn't just apply to writing, I was worried when starting this program that when it came time to complete projects that I wouldn't be able to come up with original ideas or know where to get started. Those thoughts haven't crossed my mind once when starting these projects, before I even get to project week I'm already thinking of things I could make with the technologies I'm learning, and its awesome to create things that I actually want to use in my daily life. This is what draws me to this field so much, the ability to solve problems in everyday life through technology. 

The idea for my project was to create a fishing log for the fishing trips I was taking. Im a hardcore surf fisherman, I climb rocks and jetties usually when people are sleeping to chase a fish called Striped Bass. These fish have a crazy following and are one of the few fish that I've noticed follow patterns in weather, tides, time, and season. By logging this information it greatly increases your chances of landing a trophy fish. They are migratory and being able to go back to your logs and compare the conditions you have today with the location and conditions you caught in the past, you'll have an idea of where to go and what techniques to use. Most other fishing log applications are really broad and mostly cater to the freshwater fisherman. I wanted to create something alittle more specific to my application. In the future I will add functionality to be able to analyze the data and represent it with charts and graphs so I don't actually have to go through all the logs to get the information I need.
