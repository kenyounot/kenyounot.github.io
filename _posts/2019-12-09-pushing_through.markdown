Just finished my rails project, can't believe how fast this program is flying by. For this project I wanted to take the idea of my old project "A fishing log for surf casters" and make it better. About halfway through the project I realized that the vision I had for the project wasn't lining up with the requirements for the assessement. So, after a couple of hours trying to figure out how I could make it work, I decided to scrap the first idea and start over with a new idea that would meet all the requirements naturally. I have to be honest I wasn't in love with the project and it kind of unmotivated me but, then I started thinking this is the way life is going to be in the work force. Sometimes Ill be working on things I enjoy and other times it won't be so fun and that's okay, in the end it beat's doing a job I didn't like everyday. I still enjoyed solving the problems, and having those a-ha moments which makes programming so awesome. 

I will say that after completing this project Im starting to feel like a professional developer. I remember when first learning about associations I thought I would never get it, now it's almost ingrained in me. Things are starting to get easier to figure out and I think thats because I'm starting to get better at learning how to learn and what questions to ask. Next up is javascript, I have some experience in javascript and I like it a lot so I'm exicted for the upcoming lessons.
