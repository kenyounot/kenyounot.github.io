While I was wrapping up the end of my learning program here at Flatiron I was reminiscing about the path that lead me to this point, and I wanted to reflect on why I wanted to do this in the first place. 

At 29 years old I was working in the Auto Service industry at various advisor and managerial positions. Honestly, it's not a bad job. It requires no mandatory education, a great salary(I'll most likely be taking a pay cut in the beginning), and you get to talk to people all day. Almost everyday I would ask myself do I really want to do this for the rest of my life? No. I didn't. 

I've always loved learning, whether it's working on my car, math, programming, I completely get lost in trying to learn everything I can about it. When I found programming in my early 20's, I fell in love. Naturally because it provided me with a never ending resource of things to learn, and I could take what I learned and immediatley apply that practically, but I always hit a roadblock. I would get all the basics down, the syntax, learn some popular technologies and never know how to proceed from there. I never had the confidence that what I learned could be transferred into a career, I also never knew a developer personally so I felt alone in the journey. Unfortunately, everytime I hit this block I would give up, stop programming and then 6 months later start all over again. 

I found bootcamps when they first came out, but they were pretty inaccessible for someone that lived on their own financially. You had to pay for school and pay to live for an unforseeable amount of time until you landed a job. When they came out with ISA it was like a dream come true. Being able to finally have direction and structure was awesome. On top of the help if you needed a button click away and being part of a community of like minded people is what really sets apart the self learning experience from a bootcamp one. I don't think I would've finally pursued my dream if I failed to see it through again and I'm confident that if it wasn't for schools like Flatiron that would have been the most likely outcome. I'm glad I didn't give up, I'm done with the program as of today and ready to see this dream through to the end.
