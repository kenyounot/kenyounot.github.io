After graduation I knew fairly quickly I wanted to expand my tool box of languages and technologies. It was a very close choice between Node.js and Golang. When I look at a backend language I think performance and scalability is very important. Both Golang and Node are great at both of these challenges, with Go taking the lead by a small margin. I decided to go with Golang, I felt like I already had a good understanding of JavaScript so if I landed a job that required Node I would have a headstart in learning it. Golang on the other hand is it's own language that has similiarites to C based language while also being a statically typed language broadening my skills.

My first experience using Go was interesting, the programs you create have to be built before they can be ran. Errors are also caught during the build process which doesn't allow errors to be present during run time. The language is suprisingly easy to read and understand. Starting tomorrow I'm really going to dive into the language and document my journey learning this cool language.
